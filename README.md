# Timed Shutdown

Timed Shutdown is a simple Windows application that automatically shuts down your PC after a set amount of time.

It’s useful for overnight downloads, game installs, or anytime you don’t want your computer running all night and wasting power.

## Features
- Set shutdown time using hours and minutes
- Live countdown until shutdown
- Start and cancel anytime
- No internet connection required
- Clean and easy-to-use interface

## How to use
1. Download the app from the Releases section
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Run `TimedShutdown.exe`
4. Set the time and click **Start Shutdown**

## Notes
- Windows may show a security warning because the app is unsigned. This is normal for new independent software.
- The app uses Windows’ built-in shutdown command and does not collect any data.
